2026-02-14 - Initialized Tauri v2 project in src-tauri.
2026-02-14 - Added project bootstrap docs (AGENTS.md, PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md, project.yaml, AGENT-EDITABLE.md).
2026-02-14 - Began frontend system setup for shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 and Obsidian-inspired brutalist visual language.
2026-02-14 - Added shadcn/ui components and built a dark Obsidian-inspired brutalist dashboard with strict zero-radius tokens.
2026-02-14 - Implemented frontend feature modules for ingestion queue, insight cards, note preview, and settings.
2026-02-14 - Scaffolded Tauri Rust backend modules (app state, SQLite migrations/repository, ingestion helpers, Gemini stub, Obsidian writer).
2026-02-14 - Added CLI-first + filesystem fallback Obsidian note publishing with vault detection and path safety checks.
2026-02-14 - Copied and adapted Windows no-admin build workarounds from C:\dev\sinq (junction scripts, hooks.nsh, WebView2Loader.dll, cargo GNU config).
2026-02-14 - Added Sinq architecture/workaround reference doc to C:\Users\israel.toledo\Documents\Projetos e Outros.
2026-02-14 - Validation: typecheck OK, tests OK, frontend bundle validated via direct bunx command, Rust cargo check OK after env init.
2026-02-14 - Final cleanup removed Vite starter assets and verified full frontend passes typecheck/tests/build.
2026-02-14 - Built NSIS installer successfully via cargo-tauri from junction path; output generated in src-tauri/target/.../bundle/nsis.
2026-02-15 - Added explicit junction wrapper scripts (`tauri-start-junction-dev.bat`, `tauri-build-junction-package.bat`) and package aliases for dev/package flows.
2026-02-15 - Updated `build-junction.bat` with automatic `cargo tauri build` fallback when `bun run tauri:build` fails in this Windows environment.
2026-02-15 - Updated scripts and root docs with the canonical no-admin startup/package workaround flow.
2026-02-15 - Fixed Bun script aliases to use `./scripts/*.bat` so `bun run tauri:start:junction` resolves correctly.
2026-02-15 - Added `cargo tauri dev` fallback in `scripts/dev-junction.bat` for Bun runtime crashes.
2026-02-15 - Hardened ingestion persistence with atomic transaction insert (`job + assets`) and collision-resistant job IDs (`timestamp + atomic sequence`).
2026-02-15 - Simplified TS invoke client API and removed redundant explicit async return annotations.
2026-02-15 - Validation: typecheck passes; test run still fails under Bun/Vitest due junction path module-resolution bug (`/@fs/...DESENV~1...`).
2026-02-15 - Added auto-junction scripts (`scripts/tauri-dev.bat`, `scripts/tauri-build.bat`) that infer current project name and support `--clean` and `--dry-run`.
2026-02-15 - Added simple Bun aliases (`bun run tauri-dev`, `bun run tauri-build`) and updated project/shared docs with PowerShell-first usage for any Tauri project.
2026-02-15 - Investigated `bun run tauri-dev` linker failure (`export ordinal too large`) on GNU target; fixed by removing `cdylib` from desktop crate types in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
2026-02-15 - Documented the GNU linker overflow root cause and fix in shared reference `C:\Users\israel.toledo\Documents\Projetos e Outros\SINQ-TAURI-WINDOWS-WORKAROUNDS.md`.
2026-02-15 - Root-caused persistent build instability to Bun crash when invoking Node-based Tauri CLI; switched package scripts to `cargo tauri dev/build` while keeping Bun entrypoint.
2026-02-15 - Simplified dev/build wrapper scripts to remove fallback branching and rely on stable Cargo-tauri path.
2026-02-15 - Added `scripts/tauri-cargo-dev.bat` and `scripts/tauri-cargo-build.bat` so direct `bun run tauri:dev/build` also initializes environment and avoids `cargo not found`.
2026-02-15 - Confirmed installer location and clarified path semantics: final `.exe` is under `release/bundle/nsis`, while `release/nsis/x64` is NSIS script artifacts only.
2026-02-15 - Applied Rust release-profile build-speed tuning (`incremental=true`, higher `codegen-units`, `lto=false`) and validated fast incremental rebuild path.
2026-02-15 - Build Agent execution slice: replaced dashboard runtime mocks with live React Query + Tauri command wiring for enqueue, settings save, note preview, and publish flows.
2026-02-15 - Implemented ingestion hardening in Rust: canonicalized source file validation, MIME/ext checks, 2GB cap, SHA-256 hashing, and copied media storage under app data.
2026-02-15 - Upgraded SQLite migration system to versioned migrations and expanded schema with extraction traceability tables, job events, and FTS trigger/index coverage.
2026-02-15 - Implemented Obsidian write-mode routing (`cli_only`, `filesystem_only`, `cli_fallback`) with CLI candidate resolution and atomic filesystem writes.
2026-02-15 - Added Tauri dialog plugin and permissions; validated `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, and `cargo check` (with `scripts/init-env.bat`).
2026-02-15 - Fixed recurring Vitest module resolution issue by allowing the compatibility workspace path in `vitest.config.ts` server fs allowlist.
2026-02-15 - Replaced Gemini stub with live `generateContent` integration (via `reqwest`), feeding AI summaries into note preview/publish when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is available, with deterministic fallback on missing/failed API calls.
2026-02-15 - Root-caused non-functional packaged UI to stale `dist` bundle (old mock dashboard assets still shipped) due missing Tauri `beforeBuildCommand` and non-web `build` script.
2026-02-15 - Added build pipeline guards: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` now runs `beforeBuildCommand: bun run build`, and `package.json` `build` now executes `tsc -b && bun run build:web`.
2026-02-15 - Rebuilt frontend from canonical compatibility path and validated updated assets (`dist/assets/index-Dx3Lq2E7.js`) now include live Tauri command wiring (`enqueue_ingestion`, `save_settings`, `publish_note`) instead of static mock-only panel behavior.
2026-02-15 - Validation: `bun run typecheck` and `bun run test` both pass after build pipeline changes.
2026-02-15 - Added resilient web build wrapper (`scripts/build-web.bat`) plus realpath resolver (`scripts/print-cwd-realpath.mjs`) to avoid Vite path emission failures under Windows junction/compatibility paths.
2026-02-15 - Replaced unstable `bunx vite build` invocation with `bun.exe node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` in the wrapper, eliminating Bun segmentation faults in `bun run build`.
2026-02-15 - Validation: `scripts/build-web.bat`, `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run test` all pass from `C:\dev\obsidian-ai-agent`.
2026-02-15 - Verified full Tauri pipeline with `bun run tauri:build -- --no-bundle`; confirmed `beforeBuildCommand` executes, web assets rebuild, and release binary compiles successfully.
2026-02-15 - Produced fresh NSIS installer after pipeline fix (`src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/bundle/nsis/Obsidian AI Agent_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`), ensuring packaged app includes live backend-connected frontend bundle.
2026-02-15 - Implemented secure Gemini API key flow with OS keychain storage (`keyring` crate) and Tauri commands (`get_gemini_api_key_status`, `save_gemini_api_key`, `clear_gemini_api_key`).
2026-02-15 - Wired settings UI to real API key management (set/clear/status, key source visibility for keychain vs environment fallback) and removed static placeholder behavior.
2026-02-15 - Updated AI summary resolution to use keychain-first secret lookup with environment fallback, plus clearer note-preview fallback guidance.
2026-02-15 - Validation: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run test`, `bun run tauri:build -- --no-bundle`, and `bun run tauri:build` all pass with secure key flow integrated.
